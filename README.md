# Learning to Create Web Apps

This project will be my test area as I learn how to create web apps.

## Setup

- Install `nodejs`, `npm` and `live-server` (npm package)
- Setup your project with some boilerplate. [Get it here](https://html5boilerplate.com/)
- In a shell, run `> live-server` to launch a development server. Changes will auto-reload
